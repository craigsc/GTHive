GTHive is a Android application designed to make life a little easier for students at Georgia Tech. GTHive automates the LAWN wifi network login process so that students can connect their phone to the Georgia Tech wifi network with one button press.

Features:

    * Support for ISS (ability to disable/enable)
    * Remember your login information (optional)
    * Ability to auto-enable wifi and connect to network when needed

Requirements:

    * Android 1.1+
    * An active Georgia Tech login

Currently, email support for mail.gatech.edu has been partially implemented but it does not support automatic authentication yet.
