GTHive is a Android application designed to make life a little easier for students at Georgia Tech. GTHive automates the LAWN wifi network login process so that students can connect their phone to the Georgia Tech wifi network without pressing a single button.

Features:

    * Auto sign-in whenever device connects to GTWireless (don't even have to open the app!)
    * Support for ISS (ability to disable/enable)
    * Remember your login information (optional)
    * Ability to auto-enable and connect to wifi during manual login

Requirements:

    * Android 1.1+
    * An active Georgia Tech login

Currently, email support for mail.gatech.edu has been partially implemented but it does not support automatic authentication yet.
